* Cities which latitudes are closer to 0 (closer to the equator) tend to experience higher temperature. The further away a city is from the equator, the cooler its weather.

## Latitude vs. Humidity

* No significant correlation between latitude and humidity can be obsserved. Cities with similar latitude even have varying humidity percentage.
